When I have sung my last song 
Done my work, raised my children 
Come to me 
Make sure that I'm beautiful 
Rouge my lips 
And dress me up in something red 
So the journey can begin 

Me and him, I know it
We have a shared soul 
Me and him, I know it 
We have an eternal life 

Do we meet in front of the renowned cathedral
In the country of Russia like we used to meet 
Will he be there? 
Will he sit down next to me in London's subway 
Or will he walk towards me on the way to Syria, on the dusty road

Me and him, I know it 
We have a shared soul 
Me and him, I know it 
We have an eternal life

Let him be a bird or a child then 
I'll recognize him to be my love even that I close my eyes 
It's the will of the Lord. 
Please know that the day will come when I'll see him in front of me
Even that I should search (for him) thousands of years more

Me and him, I know it
We have a shared soul 
Me and him, I know it 
We have an eternal life
